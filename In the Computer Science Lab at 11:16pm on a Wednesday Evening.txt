In the Computer Science Lab at 11:16pm on a Wednesday Evening

I sit
my shoulders hunched
in a short black swivel chair
mysterious stains decorating the faded fabric.

The artificial light
bright in the sky.
The glow of the monitor keeping darkness at bay.

Hot, stuffy, claustrophobic warmth 
that is not warm,
lacking the feeling 
of my lover’s arms wrapped around my waist

Alone.
Tears slowly travel down my face
salty on my lips.

Reading about families that never were
and bodies floating on a rocking ocean
going home.

Unwelcome in death as in life.

    -Emily Lucas



Inspired by “Frisco-City” by Blaise Cendrars

Frisco-City

It is an antique carcass eaten up by rust
The engine repaired twenty times does not make
	more than 7 to 8 knots
Besides to save expenses cinders and coal waste
	are its only fuel
Makeshift sails are hoisted whenever there is
	a fair wind
With his ruddy face his bushy eyebrows his pimply nose
	Master Hopkins is a true sailor
Small silver rings hang from his pierced ears
The ship’s cargo is exclusively coffins of Chinese
	who died in America and wished to be buried
	in their homeland
Oblong boxes painted red or light blue or covered
	with golden characters
Just the type of merchandise it is illegal to ship
