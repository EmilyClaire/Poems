Typing

black letters on a white background
extending to the right
and down 
as muted taps sound

my fingers moving quick as thought
sometimes stubmling as they try to keep up
tripping over each other in their haste 
to get words out of my head

keys cold and slick under my fingers
as I move without thinking.
the little ridges under each forefinger
letting me know that I am home
