Fall

Sitting on a folding chair
at a folding table
with my boyfriend, at the time,
sitting to my left.

pencil smoothly moving
deftly â€˜cross the page.
As I work.
On.
Math.

Is this it?
Is life just
class and work
over and over again?

I break.
I shatter.
Air too thin.
Lungs too heavy.
Too thick.

hospitals are rarely quiet.
