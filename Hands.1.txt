Hands

Caramel lizard skin
crisscrossing lines 
demarcating scales
a scattering of thin coarse dark hair
that congregates in forests
at the base of each out reaching
digit.

Three thick green underground rivers
peaking through thin skin
giving life.

Ragged short uneven nails
with transparent ridges leading to brown dirt tips
decorated with scars and open wounds that ache.
Gifted by teeth. 

Pale muddy pink palms
with white disappearing dots and brown lines
a memory for every crease
